# wfc

A wave-function collapse library in Kotlin.

_wfc_ consists of three modules:

 - `wfc-core` - implementation of the WFC algorithms, fully free of dependencies
 - `wfc-openrndr` - collection of wrappers and extension methods to simplify use with OPENRNDR
 - `wfc-demo-openrndr` - collection of OPENRNDR based demos

## Quick start

Clone project, open in IntelliJ, run `WFCDemo001` in `wfc-demo-openrndr`.
